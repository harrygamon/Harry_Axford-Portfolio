								<h3>	Personal Statement </h3>
	<p>I am highly motivated and hard working. I am looking for an apprenticeship in the IT / programming /developer industry to build upon a keen IT/coding interest and start a career as a IT technician, Web Developer or Software Developer/Engineer. Eventual career goal is to become a fully-qualified and experienced IT/coder with a job that I enjoy, with the longer-term aspiration of moving into working for a big companies such as Moving Brands and George P Johnson where I would work in a team to create something for the public that can be used by everybody. </p>

							<p>In my spare time I like to experiment with coding and different computer software. I have built a basic first-person shooter game using Unity 3D, I have also dabbled with Epic Games but prefer Unity. I very much enjoy my part time roles working with young people and feel very lucky to have had so many opportunities to do this.</p>
